Any of these rarities can be obtained through the market or by opening packs. *More on that in [Opening Packs](#opening-packs).*
#### <div style='color:#E8B366'>Limited</div>
*Now these are special ones.*  
These cards are only obtainable through the global market.  
To get notifications on when these cards are *dropped* into the game, goto [the support server](https://join.discord.cards/) and in the `#off-topic` channel type `b!limited-notifs`, and you're done.

*Here's Wolfiri, she's one of the limited cards!*

## Opening Packs
Want to open a pack *not a problem*, simply run `[]openpack [series]`.  
If you don't already have a pack, run `[]series` to see what packs there are and then `[]stats` to see if you have enough to buy a pack. If all these match, run `[]buypack [series]`.  
Want to get more than one *should have asked before :P*, simply add a number on the end of the command, like this `[]buypack [series] <amount>`. *Sadly this doesn't exist for `[]openpack` due to the Discord API limitations and image generation, sending more than one image isn't really logical.*

## Global Market Stats

There are market stats on each showing what the count, lowest and average buying and selling prices are when you type the command. *Not including trades.*

>Selling / Buying Offer Market Data  
>- Count - The number of cards being sold
>- Average - The average selling price
>- Lowest - The lowest selling price
