# Albums

## What are they?
Albums are like an extra to badges, only you don't know what card goes in what album. :eyes:
When you run `[]albums` you will see something like this...
><div style='font-family: Lucida Console'>
<div style='color:#859900'>!===== [Albums (Page 1/1)] =====!</div>
<div style='color:#BB3230'>
\- 1. ??????? - 0/12 Cards  
\- 2. ?????? - 0/12 Cards  
\- 3. ???????? - 0/10 Cards  
\- 4. ???????? - 0/6 Cards
</div>
<div style='color:#859900'>!===== [Albums (Page 1/1)] =====!</div>
</div>



When you run `[]album [number]` *replacing `[number] with an album number`, the bot will take some time to generate the image*, the bot will send a message with the album title if you have completed it; the number of cards you have already put into the album; and the image of the album itself.

## How do I add a card to one of my albums?
Simply run `[]cardtoalbum [card-name|#card-id]`.  
If the card isn't required for any albums, the bot will return with the message:
>No albums needs this card.
