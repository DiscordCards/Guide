# Quests

## Getting a quest
You can get a quest by doing `[]getquest`, `[]questget` or `[]qget`.  *You can only get one at a time.*  
*The cooldown is 6 hours, so there's enough time to consider if you want do it.*

## Viewing a quest
Run `[]quest` *that's it*.

## Completing a quest
To complete a quest, simply gather all the cards and run the following command `[]qcheck`.

If you don't have a quest, the bot will return with the message.  
>You don't have an active quest!

If you have an active quest but not the cards specified, the bot will return:  
>You don't have these cards: [Cards separated by commas]  

For example:  
>You don't have these cards:  `Audit Logs`, `Chill Zone`, `Cluckcord`, `Phones`

If you manage to gather all the cards, **congratz** but you'll need to give them to the global card database for redistribution.  
To complete your quest *once and for all*, run `[]qcheck`. ~~*and start over*~~ and you'll be rewarded with that nice sum of money that you were promised at the start of your quest. *No seriously, that's not the end.*  
You'll also be sent a message, like this one below:  
>Quest completed! **+500** :dollar:  

*Obviously you'd replace the 500 value with whatever you actually got.*  
You may do as many quests as you like. *Or don't do any at all.*
