## Balance
*It's what keeps the game economy moving.*

There are many ways to earn money in the game.  
To get your daily sum of money, run `[]daily` every 24 hours.

**I can't remember when I can do `[]daily` again.**  
The bot will tell you how much time there is left until you can do daily next.  
It will also tell you what your current streak is.

**What are streaks?**  
Streaks are earned by using the command each day to gain a higher streak.  
You can lose a streak by missing more than a day.  
>This player didn't use the command for 13 days *just shows how easy it is to just leave, you should aim to not be like this player*.

## Inventory
*Your very own collection.*

**How do I see another page number?**  
Use `[]inv [page-number]` to see what you've got in your inventory.

**How do I see another player's inventory?**  
Use `[]inv @user [page-number]` to see theirs *don't mention them if they didn't ask for it*.

## Settings
*Customize your gameplay.*

This command has four settings that you can customize.

- `displayColor` = Change the color that is used on the side of the embed.
- `trades` = Toggle with `yes` or `no` to let the bot know if you are accepting trades *this will also make you unable to start trades, you will still be able to use the market.*
- `notifs` = Toggle with `yes` or `no` to let the bot know if you want to recieve notifications on your global market offers.
- `locale` = Set your game locale *read more below*.

**I don't speak English fluently.**  
We've got you covered.  
Run `[]setting locale list` to see all the locales that are available.  
Run `[]setting locale [locale-name]` to set your game locale.  
Run `[]setting locale unset` to clear your game locale.

**You have some strange language names, is that on purpose?**  
Yes, that is totally intentional.  
The following languages were made just to have a laugh *they are based on the english locale, as you'd expect*:
 - Catlang `meow`
 - Pirate `pr`

**I don't see my language in the list.** :cry:  
We're sorry to hear that, maybe you could head over to [the support server](https://join.discord.cards) and see if anyone can help with translation.

**Can I assist with translating the bot to another language?**  
Of course, right now we need all the help we can get. To get started, head over to [the support server](https://join.discord.cards) and head to either `#support` or `#general`, ask if you can help with translating language x, y or z... one of the developers will try to respond as soon as possible *most likely Snazzah*.

**How do I change settings for my whole server?**
It's a different command altogther, `[]ssetting`.  
This command has four settings that you can customize.

- `prefix` = Change the default prefix to something a little more __**personalized**__
- `adminrole` = Change the default admin role *users with this role can change the server settings*.
- `react` = Decide if the bot should react to the global market listing or a player's inventory.
- `locale` = Like the user setting, but the bot will use the locale across the server *if a user has not specified a locale to use*.
