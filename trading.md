# Trading

## Executing a trade
*Not a market trade.*

To start, run `[]tstart @user` on the user you want to trade with and wait.
If you have been invited to a trade, run `[]taccept`. If you've been invited to trade with another user but you don't want to, run `[]tdeny` to turn down the request.

If at any point you want to look at the current trade details between you and the other player, run `[]trade`

If at any point during a trade you feel that the other player does not have what you are looking for or they are not offering an item that you want, run `[]tdeny` to stop the trade.

To add an item to the trade, run `[]tadditem [item name] [amount]` - Enter a number at the end if you want to trade more than one of that item.

If you want to remove an item *my precious*, run `[]tremoveitem [item name] [amount]` - This command follows the same format as `[]tadditem` above.

To add money to the trade, run `[]tsetmoney [amount]`. *The value that you enter will be the value that is traded, no add or subtract unfortunately.*

Once you are both finished adding items and money, both users in the trade are required to run `[]tok` to execute the trade.

**And you're done!!** *Not really, but that's how to run a successful trade.*

## Donating / Gifting
*Give to those that deserve it most.*

Donating money or items couldn't be easier.  
To donate a sum of money to a player, run `[]donate @user [amount]`.  
To gift an item like a card or even a whole pack, run `[]gift @user [item name] [amount]`
