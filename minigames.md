## Cardguess
*Running this command will make you put your thinking cap on.*  
To play, run `[]cardguess` and try to guess the card in the chat.  
You have 3 tries and 30 seconds to guess the card. If either the time or your tries run out, the game will stop.  
If you use all of you tries the bot will return the card name.  
However, if you run out of time the bot will respond with:
>@user, You failed to respond in 30 seconds! Please try again! 

You may type `cancel` at anytime to stop the game.

## Slots
*A very simple game, but be careful on how much you bet.*  
To play, run `[]slots [bet]`.
